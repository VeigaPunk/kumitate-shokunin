# kumitate-shokunin corpus

Memory for orchestration & tooling work: OMP task/hub dispatch, ufo-fsd
scripts, `crates/ufo-core-runtime`. Sources are in
`/home/vgpnk/Projects/origin-work/ufo-fsd-alpha` unless noted.

## Coverage map

| Entry | Covers | Primary sources |
|---|---|---|
| `knowledge/dispatch-shapes.md` | The three production dispatch shapes + fixture path; caps; when each applies | `ufo-swarm-wave.mjs`, `config/ufo.json`, `ufo-cli` |
| `knowledge/route-resolution.md` | `omp-global-config.mjs` resolution precedence, live alias table, fleet-map drift, retry surfaces | `omp-global-config.mjs`, `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` |
| `knowledge/failure-telemetry.md` | Failure classes, capacity subset, routing-health outcomes, outcome triple, exit codes | `ufo-mission-result.mjs`, `collect-omp-native-handoff-lib/base.mjs` |
| `knowledge/singleton-and-queue-ownership.md` | `acquireSingletonLock` mechanics, queue ownership, exec-path gating | `ufo-mission-result.mjs`, `fleet-dispatcher.mjs`, `ufo-stale-watchdog.mjs` |
| `lessons/round-1.md` | Round-1 method notes, drift trap, stated gaps | LOG.md round-1; commit `round-1` |

## Known gaps

- fleet-dispatcher settle/successor internals (~15k lines; header only so far)
- `crates/ufo-core-runtime` loop-driver and native admission internals
- native-trial launch sequence (wall handoff, pane binding)

- `omp-global-config.mjs` alias-table resolution detail

All entries are falsifiable and cite file+symbol. Opinions marked as such.
